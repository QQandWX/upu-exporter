# Spring Bindings for Micrometer

This project contains Spring-specific configurations and support that help
you to create a well-instrumented Spring 4.x or Spring Boot 1.x application with a
minimum amount of boilerplate.

As of Spring 5 / Spring Boot 2.0, a dependency on this module will be 
unnecessary, as the Spring Boot  metrics system will be based on Micrometer 
core and all necessary configuration will be present in Boot itself.
